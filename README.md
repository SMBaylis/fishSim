# fishSim
R tool for simulation of fish population dynamics

Simple tool for fish population dynamics, written so that I have full flexibility on what I simulate. Handles
generating an initial population, markovian movement between populations, mating, and flexible mortality
patterns. Assigns parentage at all breeding events to allow reconstruction of kin relationships.
